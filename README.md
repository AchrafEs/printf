#Rewriting Printf function:

The printf() function In C is used to print formatted output to the standard output stream.
It has the following syntax: 'int printf(const char *format, ...)'

The first argument is a string literal that specifies the format of the output,
and the subsequent arguments are the values to be printed according to that format.

The printf() function returns the number of characters printed, or a negative value if an error occurred.
